# Grammar for the Strawberry Programming Language üçì

This is currently not the complete or canonical grammar, but a scratch space to sketch the grammar out while working
on the reference parser implementation.

The language is whitespace sensitive and should enforce that whitespace is always exactly 1 space wide unless
the pattern explicitly allows more, such as for indentation.

## Syntax

- `ident` is an identifier in the language.
- `newline` is of course a line terminator.
- `(<pattern>)+(<pattern>)` a sequence of at least one repetition, where second pattern represents
  the separators. For instance, `ident+,_` means comma and whitespace separated list of identifiers.
- `(<pattern>)?` represents an optional pattern.
- `...<pattern>` skip arbitrary sequence until a specific pattern.
